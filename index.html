          student who is trying to be an established web developer. And at the
          same time, I'll have to continue my academic education.

          I don't know who are the two girls on the left. I think maybe they are
          working on a project together. The one on the left is working using a

          In 2022, I want to learn new web developement skills such as new UI
          frameworks, such as Svelte and Vue, new languages, such as Rust and
          Go.

          I don't have any contact with the men on the right. My community is
          Astro JS. Astro JS is lot like a static site generator like Next.js,
          Gatsby JS, Eleventy, etc. It's based on the new
          <em>Islands Architecture</em>. It supports a total of six UI
          frameworks, React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Lit & Solid JS. It also comes
          with it's own Astro component syntax. By default, Astro ships Zero kbs
          of JavaScript!
